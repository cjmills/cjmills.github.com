		<div class='about'>
			<p class='textDes'>With my sculptural work I sought to explore the theme of death and decay. I typically worked with plaster and metal as the two continually interact with one another. Plaster will rust metal as metal dyes plaster. Each piece is a representation of the fact that life is finite and in the end, everything dies. </p>

				<p><b>Decay</b></p><p>This was my first attempt at using sculpture to illustrait the breakdown of eveything. The process behind this piece involved making a metal core, followed by foam and coating it in plaster. Once I had a smooth semi-sphere, I carved back into it to get the battered form displayed in the image.</p>

				<p><b>Untitled</b></p><p>These three metal cubes started off identical. Two were coating in acid in order to wear them down. With this project I sought to display the process of erosion over time in a broader sense rather than fixate on one point in time. </p>

			<div class="pageTwoAbout">
				<p><b>Discarded</b></p><p>This project started off similar to my other plaster pieces, however instead of trying to wear the surface down while keeping it smooth, I took a knife and carved countless lines into the surface. The concept behind this is while everything breaks down, nothing is ever perfect to begin with. I also stopped using foam by this point as it detracted from the on going rusting effect that plaster has on metal.</p>

				<p><b>Rot</b></p><p>With this piece I sought to improve the mutilated nature of this body of work by using charcoal to highlight the various lines I carved into it. With this piece I exposed more of the metal skeleton and experimented with getting the surface to flake in spots. </p>
