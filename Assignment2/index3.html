			<p class='textDes'>Typically with animation I focus on more technical projects than simply modeling. WHen I have to model, I'll try to throw in a particle effect of a dynamics effect as I am trying to be either work as a rigger or in FX.</p>

				<p>This project was created in SoftImage. I was instructed to make a scene which depicted a theme. The themes I chose were death and decay as those are themes I have worked with in sculpture.</p>

			<div class="pageOneAbout">
				<p>This scene was created in maya. I was given free range to do whatever I wanted with this project. Therefore I sought to explore particle effects as well as expression based animation. An example of the latter can be found in the lights and the rocks which react to the frame number. The particles themselves are designed to automatically trigger a change in the visiblity of a shield upon impact.</p>
